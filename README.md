### CSE 203B Project: Multi-Class Image Recognition Optimization with Convex Optimized Training Data

- We downloaded fashioon-mnist folder and implemented our convex optimiation techniques for image smoothing and classification with CVXPY and sklearn.

#### Reproducing

- Move `main.ipynb` to `fashion-mnist` folder.
- Run the code in main.ipynb to see the results.
